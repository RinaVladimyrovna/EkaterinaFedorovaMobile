1. Yes, it did. I believe it took a random device, since no device name was set in capabilities for iOS. Test proceeded passing after the capability was set.

3. No, it did not. Since no application of interest is installed on the endpoint device.

4. The same as above.

5. API use to install application. Unfortunately, device should be occupied before test is run.
